# Daily-Expense-Tracker
Java Development Internship
The Daily Expense Tracker is a practical and user-friendly tool designed to help users manage their
finances efficiently. The project allows users to log daily expenses, categorize them (e.g., food, travel, utilities), and view summarized reports for specific time periods such as a day, week, or month. The
application also stores all data in a text file, ensuring that users can retrieve and review their expense history
at any time.
